-- Multiple types of Keys in Mysql

/* 
1. Super Key: 
A super key is any combination of columns(one or more) that can uniquely identify a row in a table. 
It may contain additional columns that are not necessary for unique identification.

Example: In a Student table, both StudentID and (StudentID, StudentName) are super keys. 
The first uniquely identifies each student, while the second does as well, 
but it includes an unnecessary column.
*/

CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT,
    StudentName VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, StudentName)  -- StudentID is a super key
);

/*  
2. Candidate Key: 
A candidate key is a minimal super key. This means it is a super key that cannot have 
any columns removed without losing its uniqueness property. 
There can be multiple candidate keys in a table.

Example: In the Student table, StudentID is a candidate key. 
If Email is also unique, then both StudentID and Email can be candidate keys.
*/

CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,  -- Email is also a candidate key
    StudentName VARCHAR(100)
);

/* 
3. Primary Key: 
 A primary key is a special case of a candidate key that is chosen to uniquely identify records 
 in a table. A table can have only one primary key, which may consist of one or more columns.
 
 Example: In the Student table, StudentID is designated as the primary key.
*/

CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentName VARCHAR(100)
);

/* 
 4. Foreign Key: 
 A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key 
 in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables and enforces referential integrity.
 
 Example: If you have a Courses table that references the Student table, 
 the StudentID in the Courses table can be a foreign key.
*/

CREATE TABLE Courses (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(100),
    StudentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Student(StudentID)
);
 
/*  
5. Alternate Key: 
An alternate key is any candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key. 
It is an alternative way to uniquely identify a record.

Example: In the Student table, if Email is unique and not the primary key, 
it is considered an alternate key.
*/

CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,  -- Alternate key
    StudentName VARCHAR(100)
);                         

/*
  6. Composite Key: 
A composite key is a primary key that consists of two or more columns. 
It is used when a single column is not sufficient to uniquely identify a record.

Example: In a Enrollments table that records which students are enrolled in which courses, 
a composite key could be made from StudentID and CourseID.
*/

CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID),  -- Composite key
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Student(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)
);



-- Normalization

/*
Normalization is a systematic approach to organizing data in a database to 
reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The process involves dividing 
a database into tables and establishing relationships between them while 
ensuring that the data is stored logically. The main goals of normalization 
are to eliminate data redundancy and ensure data dependencies make sense.

Why Normalize?

Reduce Redundancy: Avoid storing the same data multiple times.

Improve Data Integrity: Keep data consistent and accurate.

Prevent Anomalies: Avoid problems when adding, updating, or deleting data.

Normal Forms

Normalization is done in steps called "normal forms."

Normalization typically involves several stages, known as normal forms (NF). 
The most commonly used normal forms are:

1. First Normal Form (1NF):
A table is in 1NF if all the attributes contain only atomic (indivisible) values, 
and each entry in a column is of the same data type. There should be no repeating 
groups or arrays.
Example: A table with student information should not have multiple phone numbers 
in a single field. Instead, each phone number should be in its own row or managed 
through a separate table.

2. Second Normal Form (2NF):
A table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally 
dependent on the primary key. This means that there should be no partial dependency 
of any column on the primary key.
Example: If a table contains student ID, course ID, and courseName, and Composite key is 
(studentID, CourseID) then the courseName should not depend on just the student ID. 
it should depend on both.

3. Third Normal Form (3NF):
A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and there are no transitive dependencies, meaning 
that non-key attributes do not depend on other non-key attributes.
Example: If a table has student ID, department ID, and department name, the department 
name should depend only on the department ID, not on the student ID.

4. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):
A table is in BCNF if it is in 3NF and for every functional dependency (X â†’ Y), 
X is a super key. This means that every determinant must be a candidate key.
Example: If a table has a functional dependency where a student's advisor can only be 
from one department, it may violate BCNF if the advisor's department is not a candidate key.
